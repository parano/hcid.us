	<div class="entry-content"><h2>Background</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/prototyping/a2/title.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>The subject for our second assignment in the prototyping studio, is creating a 3D lo-fi prototype of a handheld device with physical and digital control. We have two product to choose from: an immersion blender or a stud finder. The challenge here is to apply OXO brand and its universal design elements to a new product space. Which means the device I design should be accessible and usable for a wide range of users.</p>

<p>Another challenge for me is that I have never use both equipments in my life before. So that I need to do research in the regular workflow of using these devices and study the current market of both products. After a short research, I decided to go with immersion blender because I can’t only find a blender that is accessible, so I can borrow and play with it.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oxo.com/">OXO</a> brand is known for applying universal design to deliver well-designed, easy to use tools for cooking and food preparation. I started with thinking about how to make a handheld blender that can work with different size of hands, and what kind of shape can achieve this goal. So I started to do some sketch like this:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/prototyping/a2/catchup.png" width="140"></p>

<p>Sketching is an effective way to think with paper, but to design a physical object, it’s much better to think with our hands. So I turned to hold different objects such as water bottle, catch-up bottle, or folding umbrella, and try to use it as an immersion blender. And also by wrapping some tinfoil on the outside of those objects, I can change the shape easily and explore more opportunities within a very short period of time.</p>

<p>After some exploring in different shapes and solutions, I chosed three directions to create a physical model.</p>

<h2>Model 1</h2>

<p>The first model is in the shape of a drill. It have two button on the shank to operate the blender to accelerate and decelerate. I use foam to create the whole gun body as it’s extremely easy to create customized shape. The “gunpoint” and barrel is made of wire and foam. And I put some clay inside of the gun body to make it heavier so it feels like there is a real motor inside the object.</p>

<p><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model1-sketch.png" width="256"><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model1.jpg" width="256"><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model1.gif" width="288"></p>

<h2>Model 2</h2>

<p>I design this model based on the idea of catch-up bottle. When using a handheld blender, we always need to move the blender up and down. And it’s important to let user hold the device tightly because of the potential danger when the motor is working. I found the shape of a collapsed catch-up bottle feels good for a blender, so I make the handgrip in this shape and but the switches on the position of the thumb.</p>

<p>The whole body was made of clay and wrapped it with tape. The whisk part is made of a wood stick and some foam wrapped with tinfoil.</p>

<p><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model2-sketch.png" width="277"><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model2.jpg" width="277"><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model2.gif" width="246"></p>

<h2>Model 3</h2>

<p>This model also use the catch-up bottle approach. And I made it standable with the button. You may ask why I need a blender to stand on the opposite way. The reason is that after blending some food, the whisk part will get dirty and maybe some juices were sticked to it. If you put the dirty part on the table, both table and the whisk part may become dirty. I granulated the neck part to prevent the juices flow down to the handgrip. For this model, the body is made of clay and the neck part is made of foam.</p>

<p><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model3-sketch.png" width="272"><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model3.jpg" width="272"><img src="/images/prototyping/a2/model3.gif" width="256"></p>

<h2>Test &amp; Analysis</h2>

<p>Many problems are revealed during the test. For the model 1, I found it’s much harder to operate it for short people unless you put the container on a tea table. The gun shape decided that it’s easier to push down form a higher angle.</p>

<p>For model 2, it’s hard to operate the switch button for people who have small hands. Ideally the user should be able to operate the blender with one hand, but with this model, people with small hands may need a second hand to change the switches.</p>

<p>The design of model 3 is in cone-shape which is easy to hold for different hand size. But the problem is that in making this physical prototype, I didn’t control the size well and made it much larger than what I thought. So for people with smaller hand it’s hard to reach the control button.</p>

<p>Here is an one minute clip of the usability testing with these three model prototypes:</p>

<h1>Reflection</h1>

<p>When designing physical device, it’s easier to think with our hands to see what works. Even holding a simple object can help with designing the shape. And with a little effort, you can try out many different approaches in a second which help me to narrow down my choices rapidly.</p>

<p>I found that Lo-fi 3d prototype provide a more concrete context for interaction designers to think about the interaction with a physical object. And it’s also a good practice to think human computer interaction in a manner of human factors and ergonomics.</p>
