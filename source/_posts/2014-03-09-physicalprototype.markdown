For our eighth prototyping project in HCID 521, we were asked to create a 3D model using Rhino 3D, and printer it with 3D printer. As Iâ€™m fairly new to Rhino, and Rhino is a really complex software, this assignment is probably the hardest one for me so far.

I got my basic understanding of Rhino and its interface from the lecture that Kerem gave us. And I also tried 3D printing machine in the studio which really excites me.

Inspired by all those fancy [3D printed guitars](https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+printed+guitar&tbm=isch), I really want to make a 3D printed instrument by myself. But making a guitar might be too much for a Rhino beginner to accomplish in one week, therefore I decided to make another instrument that I like a lot, the harmonica. I made it by referring to the SUZUKI harmonica I have, and it actually helped a lot by measuring the size of each parts.

The knowledge and experience gained from this assignment is extremely valuable for me. Not only I have learnt a lot about using the software, but also I start to understand the process, constraints and subserviency of industrial design.
