In the first week of our prototyping class, we explored paper prototyping through a quick exercise: to design a simple coffee ordering tablet app that allowed users to order three different types of coffee in three different sizes.

We have to make a paper prototype of our design very quickly and then test the paper prototype with users and evaluate the design.

We started with sketching out our ideas for the UI independently and then gathered to critique and discuss different approaches. Then we quickly build our first paper prototype, and test it with any people around that are available. 

The usability testing and the feedbacks from the users helped us to find some design flaws. After multiple iterations, we made a lot of improvements to our initial design and the finalized an easy-to-use coffee order app prototype.
