Hi, I'm Chaoyu Yang. I'm currently a graduate student at [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) pursuing a master degree in [Human Computer Interaction + Design](http://mhcid.washington.edu). Before my graduate study, I got my BS degree in Computer Science from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/) in Guangzhou, China. I will keep posting my thoughts and learning in the MHCI+D program here in this blog.

Currently I'm taking the HCID521 Prototyping Studio class. Under the tag [Prototyping Studio](/blog/categories/prototyping-studio/) will be a series of blog posts documenting the process of learning and practicing different prototype techniques in this class.

Also you may find me dabbling about HCI and design [here](http://m.hcid.us/).
