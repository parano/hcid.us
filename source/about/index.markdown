Hi, I'm Chaoyu Yang. I'm currently a graduate student at [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) pursuing a master degree in [Human Computer Interaction + Design](http://mhcid.washington.edu). Before my graduate study, I got my BS degree in Computer Science from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/) in Guangzhou, China. 

I will post my process and learning in the MHCI+D graduate program on this blog. Currently I'm taking the HCID521 Prototyping Studio class, and I will be keeping all the process of exercises and assignments here.

Also you may find me dabbling about my thoughts in design [here](http://m.hcid.us/)
