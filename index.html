			NecX: Wearable Game Controller for Neck Exercising</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<blockquote><p>This article and its related work is developed by <a href="http://aniket.io">Aniket Handa</a>, and Chaoyu Yang.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/prototyping/fp/cover.jpg" width="240"></p>

<p>About a third of U.S. adults deal with neck and back problems. Here we seek to design a solution, which makes neck exercising fun. For this we use two prototyping techniques to quickly answer some questions regarding the design of the solution. We then user test the solution with two participants. The testing gave us interesting insights to “what works?” and “what might not work?” This helped us to scope down the problem and design a simple game-controlling interface that can be used with variety of games. Finally, the report outlines our analysis of the whole process.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>According to recent survey, around 31% of U.S. adults have some sort of neck or back condition that causes them pain.  This condition gets worst with age.  Neck and back problems are highly correlated. Exercising the neck need more repetitions, and can easily become boring, the major reason it is neglected by majority of people. It also depends highly on lifestyle. The cubicle job has only promoted such problems. It is fascinating that there is no game targeted towards making exercise neck fun (As per our brief survey), not even using Microsoft Kinect. Here we present our problem questions, which are prototypes were suppose to answer.</p>

<h2>Design Question</h2>

<p><em>“How can we provide an environment which makes neck exercising fun?</em></p>

<p>Specific Questions</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Behavioural prototype:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>“What is the best way to interact with this type of system?”</em></li>
<li><em>“What level of accuracy will be the base line?”</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Hardware Prototype:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>“Is it technically feasible?&ldquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo; How will be the final experience like?”</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Prototypes</h2>

<h3>Behaviour Prototype</h3>

<p>In order to learn about user’s behavior of intuitive commands via neck movement, we created a rapid behavior prototype for user testing. We first listed down the neck exercises that we need the user to perform. The picture below shows some neck movements which are good for exercising.</p>

			Physical Prototyping With Rhino 3D</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For our eighth prototyping project in HCID 521, we were asked to create a 3D model using Rhino 3D, and printer it with 3D printer. As I’m fairly new to Rhino, and Rhino is a really complex software, this assignment is probably the hardest one for me so far.</p>

<p>I got my basic understanding of Rhino and its interface from the lecture that Kerem gave us. And I also tried 3D printing machine in the studio which really excites me.</p>

<p></hr></p>

<p><img src="/images/prototyping/a8/exercise.jpg" width="390"><img src="/images/prototyping/a8/mhcid.jpg" width="390"></p>

<p>Inspired by all those fancy <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+printed+guitar&amp;tbm=isch">3D printed guitars</a>, I really want to make a 3D printed instrument by myself. But making a guitar might be too much for a Rhino beginner to accomplish in one week, therefore I decided to make another instrument that I like a lot, the harmonica. I made it by referring to the SUZUKI harmonica I have, and it actually helped a lot by measuring the size of each parts.</p>

			Electronics Prototype: Pomoduino Timer</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Background</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/prototyping/a7/clock.jpg" width="230"></p>

<p>Building interactive physical systems is a great joy to me. It’s always fun to design the circuits, solder different parts and make things work. This week, our prototyping studio class gives me a chance to build an electronics prototype with Arduino.</p>

<p>As there is only one week for me to do this assignment, I decide to make something useful to me and also small enough so that I can handle it in one week. Looking at my dumped alarm clock, I decide to build a Pomodoro Timer out of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> is a popular time management method. Based on the idea that frequent breaks can improves mental agility, this method breaks down the work into intervals, 25 minutes in length, and separated by short breaks.</p>

<p>To apply Pomodoro Technique in real life, people invented the Pomodoro Timer which is similar to a kitchen timer, but can only time 25 minutes every time. The physical act of winding up the timer confirms the user’s determination to start a task, the ticking to externalises desire to complete the task, and the ringing announces a break.</p>

<p>For this prototyping exercise, I made a pomodoro timer mainly with an Arduino UNO board, a LCD screen, and a motor.  The LCD screen is used to visualize the ticking and how much time left in the running pomodori. The button is the only way to interact with the system which can toggle the status between running and reseted.</p>

			Mobile Prototype: Tweak the Tweet</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Background</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/prototyping/a6/designspecification.jpg" width="230"></p>

<p>This week, our HCID 520 prototyping class is ready to extend our prototyping skills to building mobile applications. Our task is to build a working prototype of the TtT(<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/tweak-the-tweet.html">Tweak The Tweet</a>) mobile app, to support future usability study.</p>

<p>TtT is an application that is part of HCDE Professor <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/">Kate Starbird</a>’s work in crisis research. She studies the “use of social media during crisis events, specifically looking at how the converging audience (aka, the ‘crowd’) can contribute—and is already contributing—to crisis response efforts.“</p>

<p>TtT uses Twitter to gather and direct information during crises to people who can act on it to the benefit of affected people and communities. And TtT aims to allow digital volunteers to provide information in a form that is more easily and reliably processed and analyzed.</p>

<p>We are given the design specification of this application that written by Grace Jang. It includes all the user interfaces, interactions and functional requirements of this app. And the prototype is suppose to be consistent with the specification.</p>

<p>Here is a short video demo about this mobile prototype I developed:</p>

			Website Prototype: Dub Site Redesign</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Our weekly prototyping assignments started with low fidelity prototyping to higher fidelity ones. This week we are proposed to build an interactive wireframe for a website prototype. We are giving an existing website(our very own dub website), to analyze its current content and functionality and redesign the information architecture, navigation and general layout.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/prototyping/a5/dub-site.png" width="300"></p>

<p>After an extensive research and analysis on the current dub website (dub.washington.edu/), I got a basic understanding of all the functionality and content of this site. And synthesis with three user interviews about their experience of using this website, I have the following findings about users’ usual practice of using this site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calendar is the most regularly used functionality for dub members, to track the newest events, specially the weekly dub seminar;</li>
<li>For other audience who want to get to know about dub community, the people and their publications/projects are the most visited pages;</li>
<li>The blog is less popular among visitors which may because of its lack of updates;</li>
</ul>


<p>According to all these findings, I think there are several main problems in terms of information architecture:</p>

		<blockquote><p>This article and its related work is developed by Hadiza Ismaila, Chaoyu Yang, and Chase Chen-Hung Wu.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to learn about user’s behavior of intuitive verbal commands on speech-to-text system, we designed and implemented a rapid behavioral prototype for user testing. Built by Google Drive with a person playing the speech-to-text system (a.k.a. Wizard of Oz), our rapid prototype was tested and modified for several rounds with approaches such as simple text input, editing, error handling, and cursor moving. We summarized and organized the result into different categories of interactive patterns, and came up with valuable learnings and insights from our result analysis.</p>

			Model Prototype: Handheld Device</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Background</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/prototyping/a2/title.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>The subject for our second assignment in the prototyping studio, is creating a 3D lo-fi prototype of a handheld device with physical and digital control. We have two product to choose from: an immersion blender or a stud finder. The challenge here is to apply OXO brand and its universal design elements to a new product space. Which means the device I design should be accessible and usable for a wide range of users.</p>

<p>Another challenge for me is that I have never use both equipments in my life before. So that I need to do research in the regular workflow of using these devices and study the current market of both products. After a short research, I decided to go with immersion blender because I can’t only find a blender that is accessible, so I can borrow and play with it.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/prototyping/a2/exploration.png" width="300"></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oxo.com/">OXO</a> brand is known for applying universal design to deliver well-designed, easy to use tools for cooking and food preparation. I started with thinking about how to make a handheld blender that can work with different size of hands, and what kind of shape can achieve this goal. So I started to do some sketch like this:</p>

<p>Sketching is an effective way to think with paper, but to design a physical object, it’s much better to think with our hands. So I turned to hold different objects such as water bottle, catch-up bottle, or folding umbrella, and try to use it as an immersion blender. And also by wrapping some tinfoil on the outside of those objects, I can change the shape easily and explore more opportunities within a very short period of time.</p>

<p>After some exploring in different shapes and solutions, I chosed three directions to create a physical model.</p>

			Paper Prototype: Wearable UIs</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Design</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/prototyping/a1/metronome.jpg" width="160">
For this paper prototype assignment, I designed a metronome application that works on both mobile phone and smart watch. It helps to improve musical performance like a traditional metronome while wearable device enabled us to create an even better user experience.</p>

<p>In the picture is a mechanical wind-up metronome which can produce a steady beats: “Da Da Da Da &hellip;”. The consistent tempo help internalizing a clear sense of timing and tempo while musician is playing. By adjusting the metronome, the device can produce varying tempi, usually ranging from 40 to 208 BPM(Beats Per Minutes).</p>

<p>Existing software metronomes and electronic metronomes usually produce the tempo by sound. The problem with using sound is that the sound may be interruptive for audience, and it’s hard to follow the sound on stage(noisy environment).</p>

<p>One thing I found most excited about using Pebble is vibrating on wrist. It enabled a new dimension of sensing information from a digital device without actively paying attention to the device. My idea is by setting the smartwatch to vibrate in a certain tempo, to give musician a more strong sense of the beats.</p>
